# Why do we need it

# Steps

Make an OpenAI account.

Create an OpenAI API key to use with the package.

Set the API key up in Rstudio



# install.packages("pak") # if needed
# pak::pak("MichelNivard/gptstudio")

Setting OpenAI API Key
By default, API calls will look for OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. If you want to set a global environment variable, you can use the following command, where "<APIKEY>" should be replaced with your actual key:

Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "<APIKEY>")
