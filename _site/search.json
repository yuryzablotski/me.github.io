      "description": "Welcome to my blog about Data Science! I love to play with data and try to understand the world through the lens of Statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I also love to learn, to teach and to create. Having a personal blog optimally combines these three passions. And all of this is possible with R and RStudio. That's why I love R! ",
